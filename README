Library of big integers. Â© 2014 Ethan Laur

Current issues:
right now, all bigints have the following issues
1. All numbers are unsigned, so 1-2=0
2. A constant > 255 cannot be accurately assigned (simple math issue)

Current in testing:
1. All numbers are being allocated as 64 bit, they /should/ auto-resize themselves

It should build just fine, all standard C++ operators are overloaded, 
including bitwise operators.
