Library of big integers. Â© 2014 Ethan Laur

Current issues:
right now, all bigints have the following issues
1. All numbers are unsigned, so 1-2=0
2. All numbers are being allocated as 256-bit (this is first priority)
3. A constant > 255 cannot be accurately assigned (simple math issue)

It should build just fine, all standard C++ operators are overloaded, 
except for the binary bitwise operators, which seemed like they should 
maybe be added later
